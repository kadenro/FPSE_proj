# Final FPSE project: Random Spotify Playlist Generator

Description:

- Program presents the user 10 random songs from Spotify through a front end.
- User can choose to remove any song(s) they wish.
- User can choose to add as many songs as they want. The program will use the current playlist of songs as inspiration for the new song generated.
- User can optionally export the playlist to Spotify in their account, the program will redirect them to the newly created playlist in Spotify.

Usage:

- Run opam install . in the project root directory to install the required dependencies
- Run dune build to build the project and dune test to test the project
- To run the executable, use the command "dune exec -- src/main.exe"
- IMPORTANT: in order to sucessfully authenticate and use the app, you need to send me the email address of the spotify account you want to use so I can grant you access. Without this step, you will be denied access and the app will not work properly. Email me at krosen23@jh.edu
